## Idea

**LED Controller** 🎮💡

One day, while scrolling through videos, I stumbled upon this clip: [link]. It sparked an idea 💡 in my mind: what if I connect the programmable pins of the Raspberry Pi to the remote control? Would it work? Being myself, I couldn't resist testing this idea. And thus, the project of creating my own mobile remote control was born.

## Collecting the Needed Hardware

**Raspberry Pi 4** 🖥️

The choice fell on the Raspberry Pi 4 due to its abundance of GPIO ports and the later discovered 64-bit processor, which proved crucial for the project's success. The GPIO ports enabled control over the remote, while the high performance of the board provided the computational power necessary for the smooth operation of the entire system.

## Electrical Connections 🔌

For     this purpose, simple wires for connecting LEDs proved to be the best choice 😄. They were the most suitable for soldering to the remote and then connected in a harness with wires to the board. The process of connecting the wires was very time-consuming because I'm not an electrician, and I did it through trial and error. However, after many struggles, I managed to find a combination of connections that didn't interfere with the remote's operation. When clicking the button, the voltage appearing on the wire was recognized as a button press, and it sends a signal to the gate, which starts to open. 😄🎉

# Raspberry Pi Gate Activation Web Server 🌐🔓

## Overview

This web server is designed to handle POST requests sent to a Raspberry Pi. When a POST request is received, the server activates the GPIO pin responsible for gate operation, triggering the gate to open. This project leverages the power of the Raspberry Pi to create a simple yet effective remote gate control system.

# Exposing the Remote Control System to the Internet 🌍🔐

## Overview

In the process of making the gate control system accessible over the internet, I encountered and addressed two main challenges: ensuring secure access to prevent unauthorized operation, and overcoming the limitations of my ISP's NAT to make the server accessible from outside the local network.

## Securing Access with Cloudflare

The security of the gate control system is paramount, as unauthorized access could lead to security breaches. To address this concern, I implemented Cloudflare as a middleman between the internet and my Raspberry Pi server. This setup allowed me to take advantage of Cloudflare's security features to protect the system.

### Email Whitelist for Family Members

A crucial part of securing the system was ensuring that only my family members could access the gate control. To achieve this, I configured a web application on Cloudflare with an email whitelist feature. This setup ensures that only email addresses approved and listed by me can access the control interface, thereby preventing unauthorized access.

## Overcoming NAT with Cloudflare Tunnel

Like many home internet setups, my IP address is hidden behind NAT by my ISP, which complicates direct access to my web server from the internet. To solve this issue, I utilized Cloudflare Tunnel to create a secure pathway to the web server hosted on my Raspberry Pi, which sits behind the NAT.

### Why the 64-Bit Processor Matters

The Raspberry Pi's 64-bit processor played a crucial role in this configuration. The added computational power and efficiency were instrumental in smoothly running the Cloudflare Tunnel alongside the server. This ensured reliable and secure remote access to the gate control system without compromising performance.

## Conclusion

Through careful configuration and the use of Cloudflare's services, I have successfully made my Raspberry Pi-based gate control system securely accessible over the internet. This setup not only ensures that my family can conveniently access the gate from anywhere but also maintains high security to protect against unauthorized access.
